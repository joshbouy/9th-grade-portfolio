  <p class ="pdown">
    Welcome to the about me! My name is Joshua and it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm currently still in high school. I love learning about technology related subjects like; computer science, engineering and web development. Some other intertests of mine are; blockchain, video games, cardistry, and creating vector art. I'm also a tv show connoisseur and an amateur twitch streamer. Currently, I want to major in computer science.

  <h2 class= 'headings'> goals </h2>
<p class='pdown'>
   Being as doubtful and pessimestic as I am (I'm working on it), I still have some goals, foundations. A main goal of mine, is to become successful enough to give back to my parents and let them live their "american dream." But, before I can achieve that, I need to get into University and get a good job, other goals of mine. On the topic of successfulness, a goal I have set myself is to learn different languages like; javascript, solidity, c++ and go.
</p>

  <p class=' pdown'>
    Most people I've talked to have said that I have plenty of time to decide what I want to become. And to which I say, true because I still haven't experienced everything yet. Even as I ponder and search for my "dream job," some ways I can do that is by consuming myself with hobbies. Like for instance, graphic design and web development. These are pretty fun hobbies to me and I believe that if I continue to keep doing this I can make it a job. Maybe down the road, I'll find the perfect "job" through creating websites and computer science.
  </p>

  <h2 class ='headings'> experience  </h2>
  <p class='pdown'>
     So, as a "youngin" I really haven't done much hands-on work. But, I'm trying to get out there more and improve my people skills. However, I have some experience working with people. I've worked at Contra Costa College, as an intern. Specifically, I was an intern at their Skills Center where I helped with data entry and created media to attract more students. I also work as a tutor for the college. I am currently volunteering at the Sojourner Truth United Church, with their food bank program to distribute food to people.
